## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Components
- **DocumentationIndex**: Main dashboard for viewing, filtering, and creating notes
- **Note Form Components**: Specialized multi-step wizards for each note type
- **DocumentationContext**: React context for state management and API access

### Backend Components
- **Note Entity**: Database model for storing note data with structured JSON content
- **NoteTemplate Entity**: Database model for storing reusable templates
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations on notes and templates

### Security Features
- **End-to-End Encryption**: AES encryption for sensitive patient data
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all actions for compliance
- **Draft Recovery**: Secure local storage for preventing data loss
- **Digital Signatures**: Cryptographic verification of signatures
- **Session Security**: Timeout detection and activity tracking

## Usage

### Creating a New Note
1. Navigate to the Documentation module from the sidebar
2. Click "Create New Note" and select the desired note type
3. Complete each step of the form, filling in required fields
4. Use the "Save Draft" button to save progress at any time
5. Navigate between steps using the "Next" and "Previous" buttons
6. Review the completed note and click "Finalize Note"

### Editing an Existing Note
1. Navigate to the Documentation module
2. Find the note in the list and click "Edit"
3. Make necessary changes to the note
4. Save as draft or finalize the note

### Supervision Workflow
1. Provider completes a note and submits it for supervision
2. Supervisor receives notification of pending review
3. Supervisor reviews the note and approves or rejects with comments
4. Provider receives notification of supervision outcome

## Security Considerations
- All PHI (Protected Health Information) is encrypted both in transit and at rest
- Notes containing sensitive information use additional encryption layers
- All actions are logged for audit purposes
- Session timeouts protect against unauthorized access
- Digital signatures ensure non-repudiation of finalized notes

## Testing
The Documentation Module includes comprehensive test coverage:
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for form workflows
- Security tests for encryption and protection features

## Future Enhancements
- Template library for quick note creation
- Voice-to-text integration for faster documentation
- AI-assisted documentation suggestions
- Mobile-optimized note entry
- Batch signature for multiple notes
